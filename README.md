# README file for BSU_1course_C
This repository contains my completed C++ tasks for the first course. These tasks are taken from the manuals of 2021 and 2022, developed by BSU.

The description of the task is contained both in the code itself and in the manual.(the description in the manual is only in Russian, and in the code in Russian and English) You can get acquainted with the manual by clicking on the link:<br>

or just download the manual.zip<br>

Tasks from the folder 1sem, starting from 3.1 to 6.1, I did with the help of the manual 2022. Solve all other tasks from this folder with the help of the 2019 manual.<br>
Tasks from 1,2 to 3,1 - 10 variant<br>
Tasks from 3.1 to 6.1 - 2 variant

I performed tasks from the 2sem folder using two 2021 and 2022 manuals.<br>
Tasks of computational practice - 6 variant<br>
OOP tasks - 6 variant<br>

Tasks for algorithms from the 2sem folder do not have manuals, all the conditions are in the code itself. <br>

It should also be noted that some of the tasks are written on the Linux Ubuntu operating system in a text editor, and some on the Windows 10 operating system in the Visual Studio development environment. Therefore, there is a possibility that if you have any errors, then these are simply the wrong libraries. Try to find analogs of the libraries used that are suitable for your operating system.<br> 
Otherwise, you can use the online compiler: <br>
